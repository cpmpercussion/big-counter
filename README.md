# big-counter

A Big (countdown) Counter in p5js for timing performances.

Use it online at: <https://big-counter.netlify.app/>

This is _just_ a countdown timer with big numbers that fill the screen.


## Usage

The app has one URL parameter, `seconds` which can be used to change the length of time to count down.

e.g., <https://big-counter.netlify.app/?seconds=180>

This is a very simple countdown timer:

- Click/tap the start/stop button to start or stop the timer.
- press reset to go back to the total time.
- the background changes to red at the end of the time
